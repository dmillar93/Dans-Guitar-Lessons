Dans Guitar Lessons:

This website was designed to be a webpage for myself to advertise online guitar lessons, what theyâ€™ll need to undertake them and get people to sign-up to them via an online contact sheet. 

The site provides some FAQs for people getting started with lessons, along with a helpful guitar tuning audio player to use and a list of what you need to start. 

Features:

Navigation: The navigation bar at the top of each page gives clear instruction on each pages use and where to go next. 

Social links: The links to social media channels are there to guide the user to the appropriate channels to find out more about the service and keep up to date with whats happening. 

Design: The fun and colorful design with the background image of guitars suits newcomers of all ages and hopefully puts people at ease when they come to the site. 

Sing-up / contact form: The contact form is easy to use and straightforward. It is exolained in the site that the form is to be used to get in contact to book lessons. 

Get-started page: The get started page has answers for some commen questions on starting online lessons and details how much each lesson costs and how long a session lasts along with what the students need to get started playing the guitar and a handy tuning audio to help tuning their guitar. 

Testing: I have tested the site on Google chrome and safari browsers and both work perfectly. 

Bugs: I ran into some bugs when i had first added the audio plugin that it would not play the audio. I also had to rename the audio file. This was resolved after I ammended the file path to the audio file. 

I used the html and css validators to test my code. The only issues were that some section elements did not contain heiding elements so i removed the section elements as they were not necessary for the structure of the page. 

Validation: After the first try at HTML validation i rectified the errors and now the site passes both HTML and CSS validation without any problems. 

Lighthouse accesibility testing: After running the site through the lighthouse testing in chrome devtools the site has performed well with a perfect score of 100 accross the board. 

No unfixed bugs present.

I have used the footer section from the love running project in this project and tweaked the css for it. I used the media queries from love running project as a lesson on my own in this project. The contact sheet from love running was a starting point also but all have been used as a teachable starting point and not a full copy of the original code.
